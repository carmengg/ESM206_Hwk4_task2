In this report we examine the counts, weight and size measurements of juvenile snowshoe hares observed at the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest from 1999 to 2012 (Kielland et al. 2017). In particular, we look at how the number of observations of juvenile snowshoe hares has changed over the course of the study, how weight varies across sex and sampling site and explore a possible linear relation between haresâ€™ weight and hind foot length.
